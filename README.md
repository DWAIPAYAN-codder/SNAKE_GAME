# SNAKE_GAME
#IT's my first year project.
TODO:

implement game controls, loss conditions on client side
handle win/loss on client side
extend snake on pellet pickup
expand game - powerups, timers, etc.
#########Please look at the new Implementations I've made. I have fixed the canvas size to a fixed size, and have pellets spawning all over.
The pellets should be spawning with different colors based on their values.
In doing this I also have screwed up snake growth.##########
